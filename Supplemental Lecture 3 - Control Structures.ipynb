    "## Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures lets our program do things more complicated then execute a series of commands in serial. There are two main types of control structures\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conditional control (`if-else`) - Let's you decide whether to execute code.\n",
    "2. Looping structure (`for` or `while`) - Let's you repeat code\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen examples of both of these in class, but let's formally introduce them now.\n",

    "```\n",
    "if SOME BOOLEAN CONDITION:\n",
    "     # code to be executed if condition is true    \n",
    "\n",
    "# this code isn't inside the if statement. It will get executed regardless of the condition.\n",
    "```     \n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is important. All the code that should only be executed if the condition is true should be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `SOME BOOLEAN CONDITION` is any Python expression that evaluates to either True or False. Some of the most basic **Boolean Expressions** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Boolean variables\n",
    "2. Numerical comparisons using Boolean operators `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`\n",
    "3. A function call that returns a boolean value.\n",
